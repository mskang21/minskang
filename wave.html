                    <p>In the Fall of 2021, I begun a design project in an organization called Design For America in cooperation with national YMCA(Youg Men's Christian Association).
                        We entered a CMU Design Fair at the end of the academic year hosted by DFA to present out project and won the best design award out of 10 teams by giving a short 5 min breif elevator pitch.
                        In this project, I took the role of a UX researcher to build a mobile app that faciliatates professional career building foundations for youths in high school and their peers. 
                        This project aimed to foster the youth participatoin within the community by maximizing their impacts in local organizatios with the help of mentors from the platform.

                    <p>To better understand the needs of target users (middle and high school students) and the current situation regarding successful youth activities, I conducted interviews with 6 YMCA Directors of Youth Programming across main US branches.

                    <h1>Research Goal</h1>
                    <p>	The purpose of this research process aimed to investigate reasons why certain YMCA branches attract more youth participants. <br>
                        The insights of the investigation were then used to develop a more accessible platform for youth to engage in to gain audience and partners for their independent projects. <br>
                        In such an effort, I conducted multiple interviews with various YMCA branches including high schools as well as those that run independently focused on helping kids at risk and kids with genuine interests.

                        <li>How do YMCAs recruit new members? How do youth learn about new programs?</li>
                        <li>What goals do YMCA participants have? What activities do students tend to gravitate towards?</li>
                        <li>What existing changemakers programs are there?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After gaining answers to these questions, we developed the main problems why some YMCAs have problems with youth disengagement 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Students are not interested or involved in community activities both inside and outside the Y.</li>
                        <li>Youth are not aware of programs that match their interests.</li>
                        <li>Some programs do not have altruistic purposes.</li>
