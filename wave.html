                                The purpose of this research process aimed to investigate reasons why certain YMCA branches attract more youth participants.
                                The insights of the investigation were then used to develop a more accessible platform for youth to engage in to gain audience and partners for their independent projects. 
                                In such an effort, I conducted multiple interviews with various YMCA branches including high schools as well as those that run independently focused on helping kids at risk and kids with genuine interests.

                                we also divided the stakeholders into different stages such as primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders. Similar to the persona, our primary stakeholders included youth who are motivated to make changes in the community,
                                potential youth who are interested to learn more about existing community programs both local and national. Secondary stake holders included youth program staff who oversee these programs including aspects such as the participation of youth.
                                Tertiary stkaeholders, in general, meant community members and organizations working with youth changemakers.

                            <h2>Why this Decision?</h2>
                            <h4 class="fade">Currently, most platforms benefit young and experienced professionals, yet not enough platforms exist for students. 
                                Considering YMCAs rely on word of mouth to gain a larger student pool, our team thought that building an appropriate digital application accessible to students that help them connect with peers would greatly benefit both the students and the YMCA. 
                                Such implementation would also benefit students who stopped activities due to Covid to resume programs with new people and initiatives. 
                                 An app would allow advertising on social media and other online venues for youth connections. Our team deemed that such an app would be actively and widely used by youth who are already familiar with technological tools. 
                            </h4>
                            <h2>Competitor Research:Reference</h2>
                            <h4 class="fade">Before prototyping, our team began researching UIs of competitions such as Handshake, Facebook, Twitter, tinder, LinkedIn, and Instagram. 
                                The goal was to identify how User Experience design played a role in constructing layouts and functionalities within an app to help people find each other and develop group activities and communication. 
                                While doing so, the team kept in mind the primary audience for the app which was the youth by selecting features from the competitions that would benefit the youth.

                                We also added geometrical designs that took inspiration from organic curves and shaped to decrease excessive sharpness in the presentation again to focus on the younger audience.</h4>

                        <h4 class="fade">The main difficulty was getting familiar with the design tool because this was my first time prototyping. I had to self-teach myself how to organize the layouts, how to create a design system, etc. 
                            In terms of the process, I found it difficult to find users to test these products as the targets were mainly high school students. We attempted reaching out to local students, yet it was hard to contact them as well as arrange time because our schedules were drastically different from theirs. 
                            Also, we came across potential ethical concerns that could arise while conducting user tests with individuals under the age of 18. </h4>
