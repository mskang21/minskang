                    <p>In the Fall of 2021, I begun a design project in an organization called Design For America in cooperation with national YMCA(Youg Men's Christian Association).
                        We entered a CMU Design Fair at the end of the academic year hosted by DFA to present out project and won the best design award out of 10 teams by giving a short 5 min breif elevator pitch.
                        In this project, I took the role of a UX researcher to build a mobile app that faciliatates professional career building foundations for youths in high school and their peers. 
                        This project aimed to foster the youth participatoin within the community by maximizing their impacts in local organizatios with the help of mentors from the platform.
