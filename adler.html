                        users could easily create a virtual gallery with their photos uploaded in a 3D space. With the service, the company able to raise about <strong>$2 million</strong> 
                        at <strong>a valuation of $6 million</strong> through venture capitalists' fundings. The newly designed product aimed to increase the user interaction as well as <strong>easier, faster, and aesthetically pleasing</strong> services. 
                        I was able to learn more about <strong>designing user experience for a SNs platform</strong> while contemplating the implementations of novel technical aspects of the service such as 
                        <strong>three.js</strong>.

                                    For SNIIP, we decided to increase user interactions not only between users but also authors, minimize the effort in selecting favorites from large pool of mangas available online,
                                    make the mangas readily available to read, and create a customizable environment where users can create personal spaces for the most optimized user experience.

                                    to find the time where we could meet despite differences in our time zones. It was difficult to intuitively communicate with the teammates when we were attempting to make changes in our initial UX decisions.
                                    We overcame this problem by actively using communication Saas tool and holding weekly meeting for the design and the general team meeting with the developers.
