                    <h4>In the summer of 2023, I created a mobile platform for a Entertainment StartUp SNIIP. The product intended to allow readers to have a more pleasant manga reading experience 
                        compared to other competitors in the manga industry. This was a renewed design from a previous desktop platform so that readers could have more accessiblity to our service on their phone.
                        Before launching the product, the company was able to raise $___ before launching the product. The goal of designing the platform was to allow readers in western countries to have more access to 
                        different types of mangas that are yet to be exported due to limited streaming or entertainment services and complex legality reasons.

                                Currently, most platforms face legality issues with distributing mangas to readers without consent from publishers or from authors. 
                                These mangas are basically exposed without any loyalties given to the creators of the manga as well as the formal distributors.
                                Also, the platforms tend to crash often, increasing stability issues for the users. The domains of these websites also change frequently to avoid lawful cessation. 
                                The users also face problems with random ads popping up each time they try clicking a user interface, making the user experience full of unexpected pauses and exposure to contents.
