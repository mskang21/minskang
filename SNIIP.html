                        compared to other competitors in the manga industry. This was a renewed design from a previous desktop platform so that readers could have more accessiblity to our service on their phone.
                        Before launching the product, the company was able to raise <strong>$2000 before launching the product</strong>. The goal of designing the platform was to allow <strong>readers in western countries</strong> to have more access to 
                        <strong>different types of mangas</strong> that are yet to be exported due to <strong>limited streaming</strong> or <strong>entertainment services</strong> and <strong>complex legality reasons</strong>.

                                During the design process, this persona construction helped to remind ourselves that the product not only aims to attract readers, but also authors and small creators 
                                who want more exposure of their products to the public.

                                intuitively so that each member of the team could focus on the sections of the product he or she is designated with. Despite having a general requirement documented before jumping into prototyping,
                                it was important that we allowed <strong>a lot of rooms for changes and intuitive work process</strong> rather than a systematic task oritented prototyping.

                                This allowed us to keep in mind how we would connect the flows between the pages we create so that we can build a working prototype when we finish high fidelity prototypes.

                                to find the time where we could meet despite differences in our time zones. It was difficult to intuitively communicate with the teammates when we were attempting to make changes in our initial UX decisions.
                                We overcame this problem by actively using communication Saas tool and holding weekly meeting for the design and the general team meeting with the developers.
