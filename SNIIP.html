                    <h4>In the summer of 2023, I created a mobile platform for a Entertainment StartUp SNIIP. The product intended to allow readers to have a more pleasant manga reading experience 
                        compared to other competitors in the manga industry. This was a renewed design from a previous desktop platform so that readers could have more accessiblity to our service on their phone.
                        Before launching the product, the company was able to raise $___ before launching the product. The goal of designing the platform was to allow readers in western countries to have more access to 
                        different types of mangas that are yet to be exported due to limited streaming or entertainment services and complex legality reasons.

                                Through a rapid brainsotrming session within the team and the developers, we came up with ideas as to how we were going to 
                                tackle our <strong>main goal</strong> of the product which was to make manga experience <strong>Interactive, Accessible, and Personalized.</strong>
                                With the following choices below - making a page for the author of a manga to display a simple biography with his or her other works; displaying analytics for how often, what types, 
                                what genres, and so on regarding the reader's reading history, building a personal library for users to save works to cotinusouly read, making a gamified design, and attractive thumbnails -
                                our team decided to choose ideas of "Gamified design," "Author introduction space," and a "Personal library" as out main focuses.

                                With these decisions in mind, we have decided to <strong>layout functionalities</strong> before jumping into designs. My team used a google sheet 
                                to layout functionalities for each page with rough description and ideas for their UI compoenents and navigation methods. We have also planned out the animation descriptions
                                intuitively so that each member of the team could focus on the sections of the product he or she is designated with. Despite having a general requirement documented before jumping into prototyping,
                                it was important that we allowed <strong>a lot of rooms for changes and intuitive work process</strong> rather than a systematic task oritented prototyping.

                                This allowed us to keep in mind how we would connect the flows between the pages we create so that we can build a working prototype when we finish high fidelity prototypes.
